This is the supplementary material for our paper "Multiple Unreliable Knapsack Problem".

The "MUKP_code" folder contains the three algorithms discussed in the paper, corresponding to Sections 3.2, 3.3, and 4.2, respectively. The file names are aligned with the algorithms presented in each section. The code is implemented in Python 3.8.
